## Project management

### Github project board, user stories, issues.

- Show your keyboard was developed using an agile method. That includes using GitHub issues, user stories and kanban boards.
That gave me an overview of tasks structured in a to-do, in-progress and done way.
Project board with user stories [Link](https://github.com/users/andreas-ka/projects/5)

_____________________________________________________________________________  
## Site user goal
Users of Show Your Keyboard could have several goals, share and take part in keyboards posts, praise posts with comments and follow content pandering to their interests. Users can also use the site to keep an inventory of their keyboards, meet like-minded people and, hopefully 
get a friend for life along the way.

## Site owner goal
As a site owner, the goal is to provide a stable and enjoyable user experience with a good website design that encourages user interaction. Ensure the content is well structured and easily managed through the admin panel.

## Development

- All code was done in Gitpod
- Comitted and pushed to my GitHub repository and 
[ElephantSQL](https://www.elephantsql.com/) used for Postgres server.   

## How to start a Django project
- Created a new repository on GitHub "Show your Keyboard"
- Opened the workspace on Gitpod
- In the terminal run the command "pip3 install django"
- Install your supporting libraries with
    - pip3 install dj_database_url==0.5.0 psycopg2 (PostgresSQL)
    - pip3 install dj3-cloudinary-storage (Cloudinary Libraries)
    - pip3 install urllib3==1.26.15 (Cloudinary Libraries)
- Create a requirements.txt to later on tell heroku what libraries it need to install
    - pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt
- Create your project with the following command
    - django-admin startproject ShowYourKeyboard . (Don't forget to add the dot at the end)
- Create your app 
    - python3 manage.py startapp home (created the "home" app)
- Add the apps to "INSTALLED APPS" in your settings.py file
- Migrate your changes to the database with python3 manage.py migrate
- Create an account on ElephantSQL
- Create an account on Heroku, create a new "app," and add your DATABASE_URL to config vars in settings
- !IMPORTANT create an env.py file in the top root directory
    - In your env.py, at the top, "import os"
    - Set environment variables: os.environ["DATABASE_URL"] = "Paste in ElephantSQL database URL"
    - Add a secret key: os.environ["SECRET_KEY"] = "Make up your own randomSecretKey"
    - Add the secret key to your config vars on Heroku
    - Go to your settings.py and add the following code:
        ("This will hide all your secret information on the website from being deployed to GitHub")
        from pathlib import Path     
        import os      
        import dj_database_url    
        if os.path.isfile("env.py"):    
        import env   
    - Remove the insecure key from settings.py SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY')
- Comment out the Database section in settings.py and add:
    - DATABASES = {     
        'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get("DATABASE_URL"))    
        }   
- Go back to Heroku and add your Cloudinary url to config vars:
    - CLOUDINARY_URL, cloudinary://**********
- In your settings.py, add Cloudinary to your INSTALLED APPS in this order:
    - 'cloudinary_storage',
    - 'django.contrib.staticfiles',
    - 'Cloudinary',
- Now you need to tell Django to use Cloudinary to store media and static files:
    - STATIC_URL = '/static/'

    - STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'cloudinary_storage.storage.StaticHashedCloudinaryStorage'
    - STATICFILES_DIRS = [os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'static'), ]
    - STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'staticfiles')

    - MEDIA_URL = '/media/'
    - DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'cloudinary_storage.storage.MediaCloudinaryStorage'
- Link the templates dir:
    - TEMPLATES_DIR = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'templates')
    - Change templates dir to TEMPLATES_DIR
        TEMPLATES =      
        …,    
        'DIRS': [TEMPLATES_DIR],   
- Create the following folder in top root directory:
    - media
    - static
    - templates
    - Procfile (!IMPORTANT to use capital P)
- Now add . commit and push the project to GitHub.
- Go to Heroku and follow the Deployment guide below.  


## Deployment
Was deployed using Heroku with the following steps:
- Before deployment hide the confidential data in env.py
- Set debug to False in settings.py (if project is going live)
- Login to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com) (Create an account if necessary)
- In the settings tab for the new application, created one Config name PORT and has a value of 8000
- Connect your Heroku with your GitHub account and the repository you are working on
- Then at the bottom, you can do a manual deployment or set it to automatic deployment to deploy every time your repo is updated.

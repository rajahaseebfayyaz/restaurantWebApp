                  <p class="lead">Since our modest beginnings in 1960 with a little space, ‘Restaurantly ‘s development has been enlivened with the energy to cook and serve solid, Indian-roused takeout food.

                    In contrast to other Indian eateries, ‘Restaurantly ’ was made with the explicit expectation to appear as something else.
                    
                    We realize numerous individuals love Indian sustenance, yet a large number of them loathe or are unconscious of the regularly unfortunate fixings that make run-of-the-mill Indian nourishment taste so great.
                    
                    Our menu highlights things that utilize the sound and fragrant flavors, however, forget the stuffing ghee, spread, oil, and overwhelming cream.</p>

                <p class="lead">Meet 7  chefs who have won Michelin stars for their restaurants.
                  Chef Vikas Khanna was born and raised in Amritsar, Punjab. As a child, Khanna aspired to become a world-recognised chef and around 20 years ago, he left his hometown for the US to follow his dream.

                  Chef Atul Kochhar is a well-known name in the culinary world and also the first Indian to be awarded the Michelin star for his London restaurant Tamarind in 2001. The following year, he opened Benares in the city’s upscale Mayfair district, which got him his second Michelin star. The pioneering chef went on to present Indian cuisine on a global platform.


                  Born in Mumbai in 1976, chef Vineet Bhatia has been quite pivotal in revolutionising Indian cuisine on the global front. After working as the executive chef at Mewar and Kandahar restaurants of the Oberoi group of hotels in Delhi and Mumbai, Bhatia left for the UK to experiment with various culinary styles and Indian food.

                  Creating quite a stir in the global culinary arena, the Mumbai-born chef inaugurated Gaa, a three-storied restaurant in Bangkok’s Phatumwan, in 2017. It serves contemporary Indian cuisine fused with global flavours. She acquires her ingredients locally and uses age-old traditional Indian cooking techniques to make some of the best dishes you’d ever try.

                  Winning a Michelin star in 2008 and retaining it for a record 14 years straight is an unbelievable feat only a few can achieve. Located at Taj 51 Buckingham Gate Suites and Residences, London, since 1999, Quilon is helmed by executive chef Sriram Aylur who has given coastal Indian food a global twist.

                  Strong influences of robust spices and complex flavours of South India find their due treatment and place at the Taj Campton Place under the supervision of executive chef Srijith Gopinathan.

                  When he was awarded a Michelin star in 2002 for Tamarind in London’s Mayfair, Alfred Prasad became the youngest Indian chef to win the accolade at 29 years of age. Since then he has held on to the coveted title for 13 years.
